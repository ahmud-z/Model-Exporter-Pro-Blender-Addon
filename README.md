# Model-Exporter-Pro-Blender-Addon
Model exporter pro addon for blender users.

This addon allows Blender users to easily export selected mesh objects as FBX, OBJ, STL, and GLB files. It adds a new option under the "File > Export" menu.
With this addon, users can perform the following actions:

1.Export Selected Meshes: Only mesh objects that are currently selected will be exported.
2.Apply Transformations: Before exporting, the addon applies location, rotation, and scale transformations to ensure consistent results.
3.Multiple File Formats: The selected meshes can be exported in multiple formats, including FBX, OBJ, STL, and GLB.
4.Organized Export: Each export operation creates a new folder on the user's desktop, named with the current date and time. The exported files are saved within this folder with appropriate file extensions.
5.By providing a convenient and streamlined workflow, this addon simplifies the process of exporting mesh objects in Blender for use in other applications or platforms.
